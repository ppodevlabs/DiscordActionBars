# Discord Action Bars

Create customized button bars. This project was abandoned after Vanilla.

## Installation

Although functionally one AddOn, Discord Action Bars technically is a collection of three separate AddOns:

* DiscordActionBars
* DiscordActionBarsOptions
* DiscordLibrary

To install, copy each of the three directories listed above to your _Interface/AddOns_ folder.

## Original Notes

Discord Action Bars gives you 10 hotbars and 120 buttons to play with. It also hides the default interface art. Here's some of what you can do with the bars:

* Drag a bar to where you want it.
* Set the number of buttons per bar
* Set the number of rows in which to display the buttons
* Set the amount of space between each button on the bar
* Set the size of each button on the bar
* Set the transparency of the bar
* Configure a background behind and border around the bar
* Lock buttons to prevent you accidentally dragging actions off them
* Hide empty buttons
* Define a default target to use when you have no target and click a button
* Define other actions to use when right-click or middle-click a button
* Collapse the bar to the left to fill in empty buttons
* Configure the shapeshift bar, bag bar, pet bar, and micro bar
* Set the colors for out of range, not enough mana, and unsuable displays
* Define bars to be shown when you switch into a certain stance/aura/stealth/animal form. Define a main bar to have those bars switch with it when you change forms.
* Set bars to display when you're in combat, you're not in combat, you have friendly target, you have a hostile target, you're holding down a key you defined, or you move the mouse over where the bar is hiding.
* Define macros to be run in response to game events. These macros do not use any of your base 18 macros and have a limit of 7500 characters.
* Configure control boxes that you can click or mouseover to show/hide bars. They can be used to build a menu that controls bar display and doesn't use any of your macros.
* Configure solo buttons (referred to as 'floaters') that aren't attached to any bar.

### Important 

1. This mod _does not use the default UI's keybindings_ for the action bars. Scroll down in the keybindings menu until you see the _Discord Action Bars_ header. Beneath that is where you set your keybindings. The pet and shapeshift bars still use the default keybindings.
2. Do not set the _Use For Shapeshift Form_ option on the Main Bar to any form. Why did you think the mod was spamming a warning at you when you tried to do so?
3. Discord Action Bars is not compatible with _CT_BarMod_ or _CT_BottomBar_. CT_BarMod is the mod making your pet/shapeshift bar disappear and probably the one causing your bag bar to display empty buttons. CT_BottomBar is the mod causing the default UI's art to pop back up when you zone. Either one of them can causes crashes when used with this mod.
4. Setting up bars that switch when you shapeshift. It's easy. There's a section in the readme devoted to it. For those too lazy to read the readme, here it is again simplified somewhat:
    1. Misc Options -> Main Bar For Shapeshifting -> choose a bar number
    2. Go to that bar's options. Set its appearance options and place it where you want it on-screen. All bars that switch with this bar will use those appearance options and be placed there.
        * If you're a warrior, go to Num Buttons and remove all but 1 button from the bar you set as the Main Bar.
    3. Press ESC. Click Key Bindings. Scroll down until you see the Discord Action Bars header. Scroll down to the BUTTON KEYBINDINGS header. Find the bar you set as the Main Bar. Set its keybindings. All bars that switch with the main bar will use those keybindings.
    4. Choose another bar. Set the Use For Shapeshift Form option to the animal form / stance / stealth you want this bar to use. Set the When I Shapeshift option to Swap With Main Bar. Check the Hide option. That's it. You don't have to set a single other option.
    5. Repeat step 4 for all your shapeshift forms.

### Details

  
**Overview:**  
  
This mod provides you with 10 action bars and 120 buttons to configure how you will. You can set any number of buttons on any bar or setup solo buttons called floaters. Any bar can have any number of pages and any action ID can be set on any button. You can also use a built-in condition / response system to toggle or change bars and floaters on the fly according to game events. Or you can write your own custom scripts to perform such actions. Nigh anything is possible!  

[Back to Top](#top)

  
**Terms:**  
  
*   **Action Button:** The actual button frame you see on the screen.  
    
*   **Action ID or actionID:** A number from 1 to 120 that identifies a spell, macro, or item in one of your action slots. Any button in DAB can use any action ID and a button's action ID can be changed on the fly.  
    
*   **Bar:** A collection of action buttons attached to a single frame. All action buttons on a bar share the same settings.  
    
*   **Bar ID or barID:** A number from 1 to 10 that refers to a specific bar. For slash commands: pet, shapeshift, menu, and bag are the bar ID's for the Other Bars. A bar's ID never changes.  
    
*   **Button ID or buttonID:** A number from 1 to 120 that identifies a single action button frame. A button's ID never changes.  
    
*   **Condition:** A statement setup via the various Control tabs that checks whether a certain condition in the game is true or not. Usually you need to setup conditions in pairs: one that checks if the condition is true and one that checks if it's false. A lot of the time the word condition is used to mean a condition/response pair. You'll just have to figure it out from context.  
    
*   **Control Box:** A special type of button that can be used to toggle display of bars, floaters, or other control boxes.  
    
*   **Control Box Group or controlboxgroup:** Different objects (bars, floaters, and control boxes) can be set to a particular Control Box Group. Any control box set to toggle that group will toggle all objects that are part of the group. The ID you specify for an object's group is how it's referred to in slash commands and functions.  
    
*   **DAB:** An acronym for Discord Action Bars.  
    
*   **Floater:** An action button that's not attached to any bar and has it's own settings.  
    
*   **Floater ID or floaterID:** A number from 1 to 120 that identifies the floater. A floater's ID is always the same as its Button ID and the two terms are used interchangably.  
    
*   **Keybinding Group:** In DAB's Keybindings window you can specify keybindings to be part of a Keybinding Group. Keybinding Groups can be applied to different bars on the fly and are referred to by the ID you give them.
*   **Keybinding Group ID or keybindinggroupID:** This is the ID you set for a particular keybinding group and it's what you use in functions and slash commands to refer to a keybinding group.
*   **Keybinding ID:** A number displayed to the left of each keybinding in the Keybindings window.
*   **Other Bars:** The Pet Action, Shapeshift, Bag, and Micro Menu Bars.  
    
*   **Page:** A set of action IDs that can be applied to the buttons on a bar through various commands: scrolling the mousewheel over the bar, keybindings, slash commands, responses, functions, etc. Pages are always referred to by number.  
    
*   **Profile:** A profile is one set of saved DAB settings. Multiple characters can share the same profile. If a change is made on any one of those characters, it's made to characters using the same profile. You can create as many profiles as you want.  
    
*   **Response:** A action performed in response to a condition becoming true. A response is only run once its condition becomes false and then becomes true again.

    **Getting Started:**  
      
    The first thing to do is install the mod. All you have to do is extract all 3 folders in the zip file straight to your WorldOfWarcraft\\Interface\\AddOns folder. Make sure WoW isn't running at the time. Mac users: do not use ExtractNow, it tends to change some files into folders and screw everything up.  
    You'll notice upon first logging that nothing much changed. However, the default UI's main action bar is now gone. What you see in its place is actually DAB's bar 1. To start configuring DAB, open the options window by typing /dab or /discordactionbars. If you want to hide the default UI's main bar art, click the Main Menu Bar button on the left side of DAB's options window then check the Hide Main Menu Bar Art option at the top.  
    It's best to just dive right into the options window and start fiddling with options to see what they do. If an option's effect isn't obvious or it confuses you just look it up in the readme to see if it clears matters up. For further details on configuring DAB see all the various sections below.  
    **Keybindings.** It can't be stressed enough: DAB _does not_ use the default UI's action button keybindings. You must scroll down past all those until you see the Discord Action Bars header in the keybindings window. That's where you set the keybindings for DAB's buttons.
    
    [Back to Top](#top)
    
      
    **Action IDs:**  
      
    As of DAB v3.1, action IDs have been separated from button IDs. Now any button can have any action ID applied to it. When you add a new button to a bar or create a new floater, DAB will look for an unused action ID (one that's not used in any button on any page of a bar and not used in any floater) to apply to the button. If DAB can't find one, it applies action ID 1 to the button. A button's default action ID can be set in the Set Action IDs tab of the Button Layout window. See that window's section of the readme for further details.
    
    [Back to Top](#top)
    
      
    **Bar Pages:**  
      
    Bars in DAB can now have multiple pages, just like the default UI's main action bar. The number of pages a bar has is set in the Button Layout window. You can change pages on bar by scrolling the mousewheel while the cursor is over the bar, using keybindings, using a control box, using the /dab barpage slash command, or the DAB\_Bar\_SetPage function. See the appropriate sections below for details on each of those methods.  
    A page is simply a separate set of action IDs applied to the bar's buttons. The bar's button IDs never change. These action IDs are defined in the Set Action IDs tab of the Button Layout window.

    **Profiles:**  
      
    Profiles are a set of settings you can load on the fly. All characters start out using the Default profile. You can change the Default profile's settings. Different characters can use different profiles or multiple characters can share a single profile. If you make a change to the profile on any one of the characters using it, the change is made for all characters that use the profile. Profiles can be created and loaded in Misc Options. Creating a new profile copies the settings from the currently loaded profile into the newly created profile.  
    The Custom profile is a special profile used to load settings from the DAB\_Custom.lua file. **_DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THIS PROFILE. THEY WILL NOT SAVE._** If you load a custom layout and need to make changes to it, make sure you create a new profile first or your changes won't be saved.
    
    [Back to Top](#top)
    
      
    **Custom Layouts:**  
      
    DAB supports the ability for users to install layouts built by other users. All it takes is a DAB\_Custom.lua file from the other user. Drop it into your WorldOfWarcraft\\Interface\\AddOns\\DiscordActionBars folder while WoW isn't running and replace whatever DAB\_Custom.lua file is already there. If the custom layout comes with any .blp or .tga files, drop them in the WorldOfWarcraft\\Interface\\AddOns\\DiscordActionBars\\CustomTextures folder. If the custom layout comes with any .ttf files, drop them in the WorldOfWarcraft\\Interface\\AddOns\\DiscordActionBars\\CustomFonts folder. Log-in to WoW. Go to Misc Options, load the Custom profile and voila, you're done.  
    The Custom profile is a special profile used to load settings from the DAB\_Custom.lua file. **_DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THIS PROFILE. THEY WILL NOT SAVE._** If you load a custom layout and need to make changes to it, make sure you create a new profile first or your changes won't be saved.  
    To create a custom layout, grab the Custom File Extractor mods available a [http://www.discordmods.com](http://www.discordmods.com). Follow the instructions within the readme.txt file each extractor mod has. Email it to Lozareth at [kuroi\_kaminari@hotmail.com](mailto:kuroi_kaminari@hotmail.com) if you'd like to have it posted on the Discord site. Please include a screenshot.

    **Options Overview:**  
      
    To open DAB's options window you simply type /dab.  
      
    **When typing a new value in any editbox, remember to hit enter when finished. The new value will not be applied until you hit enter.**  
      
    You'll see a list of bars in the upper-left. Clicking anything in that area will bring up options for the object you clicked. That area of the window is a scrolling frame. You can scroll down to access options for the pet, shapeshift, bag, and menu bars, control boxes, and floaters.  
      
    The red buttons beneath the scrolling frame let you bring up options windows that aren't tied to any particular object:
*   **Change Actions** - This window will let you drag and drop actions into different action IDs without having to use an action button.
*   **Button Layout** - This window is where you set the number of buttons per bar, set the number of pages per bar, create or delete floaters, and define which buttons have which action IDs.
*   **Keybindings** - DAB's keybindings are now fully configurable. This window is where you do it.
*   **OnEvent Scripts** - This window is where you can write custom scripts that are run in response to game events. These scripts aren't tied to any particular object and are unaffected by any object's state.
*   **Main Menu Bar** - This window lets you toggle display of parts of the default UI and gives some config options for them.
*   **Misc Options** - This window is a set of global options applied to all objects. It's also where you create and load profiles.
*   **Unlock/Lock Dragging** - Clicking this button will unlock all objects (bars, floaters, control boxes, pieces of the main menu bar) so that you can drag them around the screen with the mouse. Note: dragging sucks. It's always better to use one of DAB's other movement options (nudge buttons and anchor options).
*   **Show/Hide Button IDs** - Clicking this button will toggle display of button IDs in the middle of each of DAB's buttons.
*   **Show/Hide Action IDs** - Clicking this button will toggle display of action IDs in the middle of each of DAB's buttons.
*   **COPY** - Clicking this button will copy all settings for whatever object (bar, floater, control box) you currently have selected into a buffer.
*   **PASTE** - Clicking this button will paste all settings from the buffer into whatever object (bar, floater, control box) you currently have selected. You can paste between profiles. Just load one profile, copy an object's settings, load the other profile and paste those settings.
  
Most windows are divided into several tabs at the top. Clicking on a tab will bring up different sets of options within that window.  
All sliders have an editbox attached to them that displays the value the slider is set to. You can also type a value in this editbox. If it makes sense you can type in values the slider doesn't allow.  
By default, holding Ctrl lets you drag an object regardless of whether dragging is locked or not. Holding Shift lets you pickup an action from a button regardless of whether the button is locked or not. Holding Alt and clicking a button will self-cast the action in the button. All these can be changed in Misc Options.

    **BAR CONTROL TAB:**  
    This tab lets you set up conditions the bar watches for and responses that are run each time a condition becomes true.  
    Remember that conditions aren't checked and responses aren't run when a bar is hidden via it's Hide option, the DAB\_Bar\_Hide function, or the /dab barhide slash command.  
    The scrolling frame at the top lists all currently active bar conditions. Clicking the COPY button copies all of the bar's active conditions and responses. Clicking the PASTE button pastes any conditions and responses that have been copied from another object into the currently selected bar. The v and ^ buttons to the left of a condition let you move a condition up and down within the list. Conditions are checked in order. It's best to list overrides before the condition they override. The Edit button lets you change a particular condition. The Delete button removes a particular condition.  
    The Choose Condition drop-down menu lets you choose a condition to setup for the bar. When some of the conditions are chosen additional options pop-up called parameters. All parameters MUST be filled out for a condition. A tooltip appears when moving the mouse over a condition in the drop-down menu that tells you what that particular condition checks for.  
    The Choose Response drop-down menu lets you choose an action that occurs whenever the condition you setup becomes true. You must setup a condition before you can choose a response. Responses are only run once when then condition becomes true. The condition must become false then become true again for the response to be run again. For most responses additional options appear when you choose them called parameters. All parameters MUST be filled out. When moving the mouse over the drop-down menu a tooltip appears describing each response.  
    The Overridden By editbox lets you specify other conditions that prevent this condition from becoming true. As long as any one of the overrides is true, this condition cannot become true. You type in the number that appears to the left of a condition in the scrolling frame at the top of the window. Multiple overrides must be separated by a comma, for example: 1, 3, 5.  
    When finished setting up the condition, response, and overrides click the Add Condition button to add the condition to the list of the bar's active conditions.  
      
    **BUTTON CONTROL TAB:**  
    This tab lets you set up conditions each button on the bar watches for and responses that are run each time a condition becomes true.  
    Remember that conditions aren't checked and responses aren't run when a bar is hidden via it's Hide option, the DAB\_Bar\_Hide function, or the /dab barhide slash command.  
    The first scrolling frame at the top lets you choose a button on the bar to setup conditions for.  
    The second scrolling frame at the top lists all currently active conditions on the button. Clicking the COPY button copies all of the button's active conditions and responses. Clicking the PASTE button pastes any conditions and responses that have been copied from another object into the currently selected button. The v and ^ buttons to the left of a condition let you move a condition up and down within the list. Conditions are checked in order. It's best to list overrides before the condition they override. The Edit button lets you change a particular condition. The Delete button removes a particular condition.  
    The Choose Condition drop-down menu lets you choose a condition to setup for the button. When some of the conditions are chosen additional options pop-up called parameters. All parameters MUST be filled out for a condition. A tooltip appears when moving the mouse over a condition in the drop-down menu that tells you what that particular condition checks for.  
    The Choose Response drop-down menu lets you choose an action that occurs whenever the condition you setup becomes true. You must setup a condition before you can choose a response. Responses are only run once when then condition becomes true. The condition must become false then become true again for the response to be run again. For most responses additional options appear when you choose them called parameters. All parameters MUST be filled out. When moving the mouse over the drop-down menu a tooltip appears describing each response.  
    The Overridden By editbox lets you specify other conditions that prevent this condition from becoming true. As long as any one of the overrides is true, this condition cannot become true. You type in the number that appears to the left of a condition in the scrolling frame at the top of the window. Multiple overrides must be separated by a comma, for example: 1, 3, 5.  
    When finished setting up the condition, response, and overrides click the Add Condition button to add the condition to the list of the bar's active conditions.  
      
    **SCRIPTS TAB:**  
    This tab lets you enter your own lua scripts for each of the bar's handlers. A tooltip for each handler tells you when it's run. Handlers that currently hold a script will be marked with an asterisk (\*).  
    For OnClick, OnEnter, and OnLeave handlers, WoW's this variable will refer to the button on the bar that caused the handler to run. Using this:GetID() will return the button's ID. Using this:GetActionID() will return the button's action ID. Note that all pages on a bar use the same button IDs and can have, but not necessarily will have, different action IDs.  
    The this variable isn't set for OnKeybindingDown and OnKeybindingUp parameters. Rather you need to check which keybinding was pressed by using the param variable. That variable will always hold the button ID of the button whose keybinding was pressed.  
    For all other handlers, the this variable will refer to the bar frame itself.  
    See the Scripting sections below for more info.

    **CONTROL TAB:**  
    This tab lets you set up conditions the floater watches for and responses that are run each time a condition becomes true.  
    Remember that conditions aren't checked and responses aren't run when a floater is hidden via its Hide option, the DAB\_Floater\_Hide function, or the /dab floaterhide slash command.  
    The scrolling frame at the top lists all currently active conditions. Clicking the COPY button copies all of the floater's active conditions and responses. Clicking the PASTE button pastes any conditions and responses that have been copied from another object into the currently selected floater, replacing any conditions already there. The v and ^ buttons to the left of a condition let you move a condition up and down within the list. Conditions are checked in order. It's best to list overrides before the condition they override. The Edit button lets you change a particular condition. The Delete button removes a particular condition.  
    The Choose Condition drop-down menu lets you choose a condition to setup for the floater. When some of the conditions are chosen additional options pop-up called parameters. All parameters MUST be filled out for a condition. A tooltip appears when moving the mouse over a condition in the drop-down menu that tells you what that particular condition checks for.  
    The Choose Response drop-down menu lets you choose an action that occurs whenever the condition you setup becomes true. You must setup a condition before you can choose a response. Responses are only run once when then condition becomes true. The condition must become false then become true again for the response to be run again. For most responses additional options appear when you choose them called parameters. All parameters MUST be filled out. When moving the mouse over the drop-down menu a tooltip appears describing each response.  
    The Overridden By editbox lets you specify other conditions that prevent this condition from becoming true. As long as any one of the overrides is true, this condition cannot become true. You type in the number that appears to the left of a condition in the scrolling frame at the top of the window. Multiple overrides must be separated by a comma, for example: 1, 3, 5.  
    When finished setting up the condition, response, and overrides click the Add Condition button to add the condition to the list of the floater's active conditions.  
      
    **SCRIPTS TAB:**  
    This tab lets you enter lua scripts for the various script handlers for the floater. See the scripting sections below for more info.
    
    [Back to Top](#top)
    
      
    **Change Actions**  
      
    This window lets you change the action any action ID holds without having to use a button. Just drag and drop actions into the action icon. The action ID is the number displayed on the left.
    
    [Back to Top](#top)
    
      
    **Button Layout**  
      
    This window is where you change the number of buttons on a bar, change the number pages a bar has, add or delete floaters, and set the action ID each button uses.  
      
    The Button Layout tab lets you change how your buttons are applied. Each bar is listed down the left side of the window. Clicking the + button next to the box in the Buttons column will add a button to particular bar or will create a new floater. Clicking the - button will remove a button from a bar. DAB has a finite number of buttons so if you've used up all the buttons, you must free up buttons from one bar in order to add buttons to another bar. The display at the top of the window tells you how many buttons are available to add to a bar or turn into floaters. Clicking the +/- buttons in the Pages column will add/remove pages from a bar.  
    The drop-down menu to the right of the FLOATERS label will let you pick a specific floater to delete.  
      
    The Set Action IDs tab lets you choose which action ID any button uses. Simply choose the action the button uses with the drop-down menus on the right. The Filters menus at the bottom of the window let you display only a certain set of buttons such as all pages on a bar, a single page on a bar, or just floaters. The Min and Max editboxes let you apply a range of IDs to the buttons currently listed in the scroll frame. The first button listed will get what you set for Min and it will go up by 1 for each button down the list until it reaches the max. If you don't specify a max, it will keep going until it hits 120 or runs out of buttons.
    
    [Back to Top](#top)
    
      
    **Keybindings**  
      
    DAB's keybindings are now fully configurable via this window. The number on the left is the ID of the keybinding. The first drop-down menu lets you choose the type of keybinding. A tooltip in the drop-down menu describes each type of keybinding. The other two drop-down menus let you set the parameters for the keybinding type: bar to use, button to use, page to use, group's ID, etc. The Run On Key Down and Up checkboxes let you set when the keybinding performs its action. Checking Down causes the action to be performed when the keybinding is pressed. Checking Up causes the action to be performed when the keybinding is released. Both can be checked to so that the action is performed upon both press and release of the keybinding. The two red buttons let you bind a key or key combination to the keybinding. Just click the button then press your key combination.  
    DAB's keybindings are no longer automatically updated when change the number of buttons on a bar. However, the Auto-Configure button at the bottom of the Keybindings window can help with that. Clicking it will setup a keybinding for each button on bars 1 through 5, a keybinding for each floater, a keybinding for each control box, two keybinding groups, and page up and page down keybindings for each bar with multiple pages.
    
    [Back to Top](#top)
    
      
    **OnEvent Scripts**  
      
    This window lets you write lua scripts that are run in response to game events. These scripts aren't attached to object and aren't affected by any object's state unlike the script handlers in the Scripts tab for an object. Choose an event in the drop-down menu at the top and enter the script for that event in the large editbox. Events that have scripts are marked with an asterisk (\*). A tooltip in the drop-down menu describes each event.  
    The Add Events button can be used to add a new event to the list of selectable events. Clicking it pops up a small window. Type in the actual name of the event in the Event editbox. Type in the name the drop-down menu displays for the event in the Name editbox. Type in a tooltip for the event in the Desc editbox.  
    A list of WoW's events can be found here: [http://www.wowwiki.com/Events\_(API)](http://www.wowwiki.com/Events_%28API%29)

    **WoW's Texture Specifications:**  
      
    
*   Must be a .tga or .blp file.
*   32 bits per pixel.
*   Must have an alpha channel. I use Photoshop 6.0 which creates an alpha channel just by adding a new channel. With Photoshop 7.0 and possibly later versions you'll need the alpha channel plug-in:  
    [http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544)
*   The height and width must be a power of 2 - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512.
*   Neither height nor width can be greater than 512.
*   You must completely exit and restart WoW to get it to recognize a texture you just added a folder. Texture files added while WoW was running won't be recognized.
*   Futrtrubl has created a tutorial for Photoshop users that can be viewed here: [http://www.edowner.net/Texture-Tutorial](http://www.edowner.net/Texture-Tutorial)
